# LGMVIP-WebDev

Tasks :-
There were 3 tasks given in total and to get our certificates we had to perform at least(2 tasks).

The Tasks which I performed were as follows :-

Task 1

In this task, we have to create a single-page website using the design layout given using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The video link for the task is:

Task 2
In this task, we have to create a react website in which we have to create a user grid layout having a navbar showing any brand name, and when we click the button “Get Users” the API fetches data.

Overall, it was a great learning experience. I previously knew HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, but during the internship, I learned ReactJs and successfully created my first website using React in Task 2. Challenges keep us thriving to achieve more and we should keep our learning graph always high.
Thank you, for reading till here. I am glad to complete this internship and I recommend everyone to grab this amazing opportunity the LetsGrowMore is offering us !
